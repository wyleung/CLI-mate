CLI-mate
========

In the agile development environment of bioinformatics, many command line tools are created quickly to fill in gaps
between complex information processes. A command line interface (CLI) is sometimes sufficient for the task, but it
limits adoption by a broader audience. As such, it's often necessary for the developer to create a CLI wrapper that
provides a more user friendly interface. CLI-mate was developed to systematize and expedite this very time consuming
process.
